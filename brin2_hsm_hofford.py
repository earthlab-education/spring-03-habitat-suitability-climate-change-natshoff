# # Habitat suitability under climate change
# 
# This coding challenge is to develop a fuzzy logic habitat suitability model 
# for the invasive perennial grass species, *Bromus inermis* (Smooth brome).
# 
# I draw on species distribution data from GBIF, climate data from the MACAv2 dataset,
# soil data from Polaris, and topographic data from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTMGL3).
# 
# Using species tolerance information from the USDA, extension documents, and the scientific literature,
# I create tolerance ranges for this species and investigate habitat suitability at two national grasslands: 
# Pawnee National Grassland (NE Colorado) and Thunder Basin National Grassland (NE Wyoming).
# I investigate how this suitability might change across four different climate scenarios representing
# hot/dry, hot/wet, cold/dry, and cold/wet climate futures.

# ## STEP 1: Study overview
# 
# ### Step 1a: Select a species
# ***Bromus inermis***, also known as smooth brome, is a perennial non-native grass common across the United States and distrubuted across the world. Smooth brome is sometimes planted for soil stabilization or for forage (cite), but in some cases can become a monoculture and drastically decrease native species biodiversity (cite).
# 
# Smooth brome is native to ... and was introduced in ... for ... 
# 
# This species is not currently listed as a noxious weed in Colorado or Wyoming, yet many land managers recongize the potential negative impact of this species and are working to control it (cite Louisville). It may become even more relevant as managers are increasingly using pre-emergent herbicides like imaziflan to control annual invasive grasses. Smooth brome is a perennial grass and thus not affected by this type of herbicide. After the monoculture of annual invasives are removed, perennial invasives like smooth brome can outcompete natives and become a secondary issue.
# 
# 
# **Question:** Climate change can also alter the impact and spread of invasive species. It is important to understand the climate, environmental, and ecological variables that control the niche boundary of invasive species in order to make effective management decisions that will be relevant under a changing climate. For this project, I was curious if the habitat of protected areas like Pawnee and Thunder Basin Naitonal Grasslands and the surronding areas will become more suitable for smooth brome under different climate change scenarios.

# **Pawnee National Grassland**
# Location: Northeastern Colorado
# Ecology: This area is primarily short (e.g. buffalo grass, blue grama) and mixed-grass 
# (western wheatgrass, needle-and-thread grass) prairie with additional vegetation types 
# (e.g. shrub steppe, scarp woodlands) at higher elevation areas 
# [(Hazlett, 1998)](https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/25015).
# 
# **Thunder Basin National Grassland**
# Location: Northeastern Wyoming
# Ecology: This grassland is interesting because it lies along the ecotone between the 
# Great Plains (mixed-grass prairie) to the east and the shrub steppe to the west. This 
# follows a gradient of precipitation, temperature, and elevation. Typical grassland 
# species are blue grama, needle-and-thread, and western wheatgrass, while shrubs are 
# primarily Wyoming big sagebrush 
# [(Porensky & Blumenthal, 2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-016-1225-z).
# 
# **Projections for the future**
# Both grasslands are highly fragmented and face risks from climate change and land 
# development. Because private parcels are intermixed within the grasslands, management 
# is difficult to apply across a broad scale. This may also make climate-adapted 
# management more challenging, as land managers will need to contend with both climate 
# variability and changes in land use from private owner development. Land development 
# also represents a vector for invasive species introduction and establishment, as species 
# can be transported on construction equipment [(Westbrooks, 1998)](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/govdocs/490/), or outcompete natives after 
# disturbance [(Hobbs & Huenneke, 1992)](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.06030324.x).

# ### Step 1c: Select time periods
# 
# I chose the time periods **2006-2035** and **2036-2070**. I was curious to compare a historical baseline (2006-2035) to a management relevent projection in the near future (2036-2070). 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Step 1d: Select climate models
# 
# **Climate model selection**
# I used the [INHABIT tool](https://gis.usgs.gov/inhabit/) from the USGS [(Jarnavich et at., 2024)](https://neobiota.pensoft.net/article/134842/) to determine what environmental factors were most associated with high abundance of smooth brome. The INHABIT tool uses species distribution models to predict habitat suitability for various invasive species. This is similar to our fuzzy model approach but more robust, as these models (MAXNET, BRT, GLM, MARS, RF) are trained using actual plant observations, instead of us manually determining environmental tolerance from the literature.
# 
# For the maximum entropy (MAXENT) model, growing season precipitation and mean min winter temperature were the most important for predicting smooth brome high abundance. 
# ![image.png](images\inhabit_vars.png). Therefore, I tried to chose climate scenarios using the [Climate Toolbox](https://climatetoolbox.org/tool/Future-Climate-Scatter) that captured the most variation in these characteristics (Hegewisch & Abatzoglou, Future Climate Scatter web tool).
# 
# I chose the following models to try and capture hot/dry, hot/wet, cold/dry, and cold/wet climate futures. Note: the models for cold/dry and cold/wet are swapped for Pawnee and Thunder Basin, as they perform differently between these two locations. See figure 3.
# 
# | Future Type | Climate Model |
# |---|---|
# | Hot/Dry | HadGEM2-ES365 |
# | Hot/Wet | MIROC-ESM |
# | Cold/Dry | IPSL-CM5A-MR (Pawnee) / MRI-CGCM3 (Thunder Basin) |
# | Cold/Wet | IPSL-CM5A-MR (Thunder Basin) / MRI-CGCM3 (Pawnee) |

# **Differences across sites**
# As mentioned earlier, Thunder Basin spans a precipitation and temperature gradient (wetter/cooler in the east, drier/warmer in the west). This gradient is notable across different climate models. This contrasts with Pawnee, which is more homogenous across the entire site.
# 
# **Differences across models**
# | Future Type | Climate Model |
# |---|---|
# | Hot/Dry | HadGEM2-ES365 |
# | Hot/Wet | MIROC-ESM |
# | Cold/Dry | IPSL-CM5A-MR (Pawnee) / MRI-CGCM3 (Thunder Basin) |
# | Cold/Wet | IPSL-CM5A-MR (Thunder Basin) / MRI-CGCM3 (Pawnee) |
# 
# The effect of the hot/dry (HadGEM2-ES365) and hot/wet (MIROC-ESM) models are clear across both sites, but most evident when comparing temperatures between time periods. It's important to note that even the cold climate models show temperature increases for the 2036-2070 time period. See above for a description of how I chose these specific climate models.

# ## Results Summary
# 
# | Future Type | Climate Model |
# |---|---|
# | Hot/Dry | HadGEM2-ES365 |
# | Hot/Wet | MIROC-ESM |
# | Cold/Dry | IPSL-CM5A-MR (Pawnee) / MRI-CGCM3 (Thunder Basin) |
# | Cold/Wet | IPSL-CM5A-MR (Thunder Basin) / MRI-CGCM3 (Pawnee) |
# 
# Habitat suitability projections under RCP 8.5 (2006-2035; 2036-2070) varied across climate models and sites. MIROC-ESM, the hot/wet future scenario, projected increased suitability across both Pawnee and Thunder Basin, likely reflecting the positive relationship between smooth brome growth and increased growing season precipitation. In contrast, IPSL-CM5A-MR (cold/dry at Pawnee) projected decreased suitability across the entirety of Pawnee National Grassland, while showing modest increases in the northeastern portion of Thunder Basin. HadGEM2-ES365 (hot/dry) also decreased suitability at Pawnee and produced only marginal gains in the northeastern region of Thunder Basin. MRI-CGCM3 (cold/dry at Thunder Basin) projected a slight increase in suitability at Pawnee.
# 
# Across models, suitability patterns were driven by growing season precipitation and soil pH, with drier future scenarios consistently producing less suitable conditions. The suitability of the NE portion of Thunder Basin is a reflection of that area experiencing enough rainfall to buffer the effects of a drier climate future. The SE portion (more grassland),does not experience enough rainfall and thus is unsuitable under drier scenarios.
# 
# Temperature responses were more difficult to capture due to the limited availability of optimal winter temperature data for smooth brome. The current linear ramp membership function captures the lower threshold (-41.67°C) but does not reflect any thermal optima, which definetely exists for this species. This modelwould benefit strongly from more specific temperature threshold information.
